Public url endpoint to use for Glance/Glare versions response.

This is the public url endpoint that will appear in the Glance/Glare
"versions" response. If no value is specified, the endpoint that is
displayed in the version's response is that of the host running the
API service. Change the endpoint to represent the proxy URL if the
API service is running behind a proxy. If the service is running
behind a load balancer, add the load balancer's URL for this value.

Possible values:
    * None
    * Proxy URL
    * Load balancer URL

Related options:
