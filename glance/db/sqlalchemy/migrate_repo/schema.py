    Import a migration file and return the module

    :param module_name: name of migration module to import from
        (ex: 001_add_images_table)
    :param fromlist: list of items to import (ex: define_images_table)
    :returns: module object

    This bit of ugliness warrants an explanation:

        As you're writing migrations, you'll frequently want to refer to
        tables defined in previous migrations.

        In the interest of not repeating yourself, you need a way of importing
        that table into a 'future' migration.

        However, tables are bound to metadata, so what you need to import is
        really a table factory, which you can late-bind to your current
        metadata object.

        Moreover, migrations begin with a number (001...), which means they
        aren't valid Python identifiers. This means we can't perform a
        'normal' import on them (the Python lexer will 'splode). Instead, we
        need to use __import__ magic to bring the table-factory into our
        namespace.

    Example Usage:

        (define_images_table,) = from_migration_import(
            '001_add_images_table', ['define_images_table'])

        images = define_images_table(meta)

        # Refer to images table
