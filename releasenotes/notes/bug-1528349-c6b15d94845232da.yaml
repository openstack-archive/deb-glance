    Glance and Nova contain nearly identical digital signature modules. In
    order to better maintain and evolve this code and to eliminate
    the possibility that the modules diverge, we propose removing this code
    and instead using the new cursive library. Please read the other section
    for more details.
other:
  - The cursive library is an OpenStack project which implements
    OpenStack-specific verification of digital signatures. In Newton, the
    majority of the signature verification code was removed from Glance.
    Cursive has been added to Glance as a dependency and will be installed by
    default. Glance uses the Cursive library's functionality to verify digital
    signatures. To familiarize yourself with this new dependency and see the
