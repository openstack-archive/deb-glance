prelude: >
    s3 store driver has been removed.
upgrade:
  - The latest release of glance_store library does not
    have the support for s3 driver. All code references of
    s3 have been removed from the library. As this release
    of Glance uses the updated glance_store library, you
    will find s3 driver support removed from Glance too.
    One such important example is the location strategy
    which no longer has s3 support.
