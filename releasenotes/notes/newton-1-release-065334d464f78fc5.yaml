    Several in-tree documentation updates exist in newton-1.
    An important bug 1570789 that will handle 4 byte unicode
    chars for metadefs APIs is fixed which will prevent 500s
    on the same. Deprecated sign-the-hash approach for image
    signing and old run_tests and related scripts have been
    removed.
upgrade:
  - The image signature verification feature has been updated
    to follow the "sign-the-data" approach, which uses a
    signature of the image data directly. The prior deprecated
    "sign-the-hash" approach, which uses a signature of an MD5
    hash of the image data, has been removed.
security:
  - The initial implementation of the image signature
    verification feature in Glance was insecure, because it
    relied on an MD5 hash of the image data. More details can
    be found in bug 1516031. This "sign-the-hash" approach was
    deprecated in Mitaka, and removed in newton-1.
