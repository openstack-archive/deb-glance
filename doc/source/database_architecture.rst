Glance database architecture
============================

Glance Database Public API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Glance Database API contains several methods for moving image metadata to
and from persistent storage. You can find a list of public methods grouped by
category below.

Common parameters for image methods
-----------------------------------

The following parameters can be applied to all of the image methods below:
 - ``context`` — corresponds to a glance.context.RequestContext
   object, which stores the information on how a user accesses
   the system, as well as additional request information.
 - ``image_id`` — a string corresponding to the image identifier.
 - ``memb_id`` — a string corresponding to the member identifier
   of the image.

Image basic methods
-------------------

**Image processing methods:**

#. ``image_create(context, values)`` — creates a new image record
   with parameters listed in the *values* dictionary. Returns a
   dictionary representation of a newly created
   *glance.db.sqlalchemy.models.Image* object.
#. ``image_update(context, image_id, values, purge_props=False,
   from_state=None)`` — updates the existing image with the identifier
   *image_id* with the values listed in the *values* dictionary. Returns a
   dictionary representation of the updated *Image* object.

 Optional parameters are:
     - ``purge_props`` — a flag indicating that all the existing
       properties not listed in the *values['properties']* should be
       deleted;
     - ``from_state`` — a string filter indicating that the updated
       image must be in the specified state.

#. ``image_destroy(context, image_id)`` — deletes all the database
   record of an image with the identifier *image_id* (like tags,
   properties, and members) and sets a 'deleted' status on all the
   image locations.
#. ``image_get(context, image_id, force_show_deleted=False)`` —
   gets an image with the identifier *image_id* and returns its
   dictionary representation. The parameter *force_show_deleted* is
   a flag that indicates to show image info even if it was
   'deleted', or its 'pending_delete' statuses.
#. ``image_get_all(context, filters=None, marker=None, limit=None,
   sort_key=None, sort_dir=None, member_status='accepted',
   is_public=None, admin_as_user=False, return_tag=False)`` — gets
   all the images that match zero or more filters.

 Optional parameters are:
     - ``filters`` — dictionary of filter keys and values. If a 'properties'
       key is present, it is treated as a dictionary of key/value filters in
       the attribute of the image properties.
     - ``marker`` — image id after which a page should start.
     - ``limit`` — maximum number of images to return.
     - ``sort_key`` — list of image attributes by which results should
       be sorted.
     - ``sort_dir`` — direction in which results should be sorted
       (asc, desc).
     - ``member_status`` — only returns shared images that have this
       membership status.
     - ``is_public`` — if true, returns only public images. If false,
       returns only private and shared images.
     - ``admin_as_user`` — for backwards compatibility. If true, an admin
       sees the same set of images that would be seen by a regular user.
     - ``return_tag`` — indicates whether an image entry in the result
       includes its relevant tag entries. This can improve upper-layer
       query performance and avoid using separate calls.

Image location methods
----------------------

**Image location processing methods:**

#. ``image_location_add(context, image_id, location)`` —
   adds a new location to an image with the identifier *image_id*. This
   location contains values listed in the dictionary *location*.
#. ``image_location_update(context, image_id, location)`` — updates
   an existing location with the identifier *location['id']*
   for an image with the identifier *image_id* with values listed in
   the dictionary *location*.
#. ``image_location_delete(context, image_id, location_id, status,
   delete_time=None)`` — sets a 'deleted' or 'pending_delete'
   *status* to an existing location record with the identifier
   *location_id* for an image with the identifier *image_id*.

Image property methods
----------------------

.. warning:: There is no public property update method.
   So if you want to modify it, you have to delete it first
   and then create a new one.

**Image property processing methods:**

#. ``image_property_create(context, values)`` — creates
   a property record with parameters listed in the *values* dictionary
   for an image with *values['id']*. Returns a dictionary representation
   of a newly created *ImageProperty* object.
#. ``image_property_delete(context, prop_ref, image_ref)`` — deletes an
   existing property record with a name *prop_ref* for an image with
   the identifier *image_ref*.

Image member methods
--------------------

**Methods to handle image memberships:**

#. ``image_member_create(context, values)`` — creates a member record
   with properties listed in the *values* dictionary for an image
   with *values['id']*. Returns a dictionary representation
   of a newly created *ImageMember* object.
#. ``image_member_update(context, memb_id, values)`` — updates an
   existing member record with properties listed in the *values*
   dictionary for an image with *values['id']*. Returns a dictionary
   representation of an updated member record.
#. ``image_member_delete(context, memb_id)`` — deletes  an existing
   member record with *memb_id*.
#. ``image_member_find(context, image_id=None, member=None, status=None)``
   — returns all members for a given context with optional image
   identifier (*image_id*), member name (*member*), and member status
   (*status*) parameters.
#. ``image_member_count(context, image_id)`` — returns a number of image
   members for an image with *image_id*.

Image tag methods
-----------------

**Methods to process images tags:**

#. ``image_tag_set_all(context, image_id, tags)`` — changes all the
   existing tags for an image with *image_id* to the tags listed
   in the *tags* param. To remove all tags, a user just should provide
   an empty list.
#. ``image_tag_create(context, image_id, value)`` — adds a *value*
   to tags for an image with *image_id*. Returns the value of a
   newly created tag.
#. ``image_tag_delete(context, image_id, value)`` — removes a *value*
   from tags for an image with *image_id*.
#. ``image_tag_get_all(context, image_id)`` — returns a list of tags
   for a specific image.

Image info methods
------------------

The next two methods inform a user about his or her ability to modify
and view an image. The *image* parameter here is a dictionary representation
of an *Image* object.

#. ``is_image_mutable(context, image)`` — informs a user
   about the possibility to modify an image with the given context.
   Returns True if the image is mutable in this context.
#. ``is_image_visible(context, image, status=None)`` — informs about
   the possibility to see the image details with the given context
   and optionally with a status. Returns True if the image is visible
   in this context.
