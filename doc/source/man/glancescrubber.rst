SYNOPSIS
========

glance-scrubber [options]

DESCRIPTION
===========

glance-scrubber is a utility that cleans up images that have been deleted. The
mechanics of this differ depending on the backend store and pending_deletion
options chosen.

Multiple glance-scrubbers can be run in a single deployment, but only one of
them may be designated as the 'cleanup_scrubber' in the glance-scrubber.conf
file. The 'cleanup_scrubber' coordinates other glance-scrubbers by maintaining
the master queue of images that need to be removed.

The glance-scubber.conf file also specifies important configuration items such
as the time between runs ('wakeup_time' in seconds), length of time images
can be pending before their deletion ('cleanup_scrubber_time' in seconds) as
well as registry connectivity options.

glance-scrubber can run as a periodic job or long-running daemon.
