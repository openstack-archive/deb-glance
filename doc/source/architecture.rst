==================
Basic architecture
==================

OpenStack Glance has a client-server architecture that provides a REST API
to the user through which requests to the server can be performed.

A Glance Domain Controller manages the internal server operations
that is divided into layers. Specific tasks are implemented
by each layer.

All the file (Image data) operations are performed using
glance_store library, which is responsible for interaction with external
storage back ends and (or) local filesystem(s). The glance_store library
provides a uniform interface to access the backend stores.

Glance uses a central database (Glance DB) that is shared amongst all
the components in the system and is sql-based by default. Other types
of database backends are somewhat supported and used by operators
but are not extensively tested upstream.

   :alt: OpenStack Glance Architecture Diagram.
         Consists of 5 main blocks: "Client" "Glance" "Keystone"
         "Glance Store" and "Supported Storages".
         Glance block exposes a REST API.  The REST API makes use of the
         AuthZ Middleware and a Glance Domain Controller, which contains
         Auth, Notifier, Policy, Quota, Location and DB.  The Glance Domain
         Controller makes use of the Glance Store (which is external to the
         Glance block), and (still within the Glance block) it makes use of
         the Database Abstraction Layer, and (optionally) the Registry Layer.
         The Registry Layer makes use of the Database Abstraction Layer. The
         Database abstraction layer exclusively makes use of the Glance
         Database.
         The Client block makes use of the Rest API (which exists in the
         Glance block) and the Keystone block.
         The Glance Store block contains AuthN which makes use of the
         Keystone block, and it also contains Glance Store Drivers, which
         exclusively makes use of each of the storage systems in the
         Supported Storages block.  Within the Supported Storages block,
         there exist the following storage systems, none of which make use
         of anything else: Filesystem, Swift, Ceph, "ellipses", Sheepdog.
         A complete list is given by the currently  available drivers in
         glance_store/_drivers.

.. centered:: Image 1. OpenStack Glance Architecture

Following components are present in the Glance architecture:

* **A client** - any application that makes use of a Glance server.

* **REST API** - Glance functionalities are exposed via REST.

* **Database Abstraction Layer (DAL)** - an application programming interface
    (API) that unifies the communication between Glance and databases.

* **Glance Domain Controller** - middleware that implements the main
    Glance functionalities such as authorization, notifications, policies,
    database connections.

* **Glance Store** - used to organize interactions between Glance and various
    data stores.

* **Registry Layer** - optional layer that is used to organise secure
    communication between the domain and the DAL by using a separate service.
