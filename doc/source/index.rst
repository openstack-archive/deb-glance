Welcome to Glance's documentation!
==================================

The Glance project provides a service where users can upload and discover
data assets that are meant to be used with other services. This currently
includes images and metadata definitions.

Glance image services include discovering, registering, and
retrieving virtual machine images. Glance has a RESTful API that allows
querying of VM image metadata as well as retrieval of the actual image.

VM images made available through Glance can be stored in a variety of
locations from simple filesystems to object-storage systems like the
OpenStack Swift project.

Glance, as with all OpenStack projects, is written with the following design
guidelines in mind:

* **Component based architecture**: Quickly add new behaviors
* **Highly available**: Scale to very serious workloads
* **Fault tolerant**: Isolated processes avoid cascading failures
* **Recoverable**: Failures should be easy to diagnose, debug, and rectify
* **Open standards**: Be a reference implementation for a community-driven api

This documentation is generated by the Sphinx toolkit and lives in the source
tree.  Additional documentation on Glance and other components of OpenStack can
be found on the `OpenStack wiki`_.
